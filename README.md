# 45m
A command line timer that plays a song to get you up out of your seat and stretch.

I had been using a modified version of https://breaktimer.app to do something similar but I like the simplicity of this script and the fact that I can just start or stop it with just a few keystrokes.

Dependancies:

```zshell
brew install shpotify
brew install utimer
brew install cliclick
```
you may want to:

```zshell
echo "alias stop='killall VLC'" >> ~/.zshrc
```
